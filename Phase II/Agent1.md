# Agent 1 Tasks

Agent 1 will handle the heavy lifting for Phase II features that must be in place before other work can proceed.

- [ ] Design and implement the **Advanced Quiz System** outlined in README lines 240-244. This includes support for multiple question types, scoring logic, and certificate generation.
- [ ] Extend the Prisma schema and API routes to store quiz data and user results, ensuring progress can still be persisted server-side as noted in README lines 292-301.
- [ ] Build React components for the new question types and scoring display, integrating with existing state persistence.
- [ ] Provide certificate templates and a generation mechanism (e.g., PDF or image export) once a user completes the quiz.
- [ ] Write initial unit tests for the quiz engine using the Jest and React Testing Library setup.
- [ ] Document the architecture decisions for the quiz system so other agents can integrate their work.
